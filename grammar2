# introduction:
# in this file we first included the old rules with weights that make the more common ones more common in the generated sentences.
# the metodolgy we used is first to analyse the parsing tree of the sentences and then to derive rules
# than, we modified the Rules to fit the complexities of the Rules Combinations
